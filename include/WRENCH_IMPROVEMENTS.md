- **Visibility**: Much larger openings for better visibility when zoomed in

#### **Knurling Pattern**
- **6 Grooves**: Evenly distributed around the knob
- **Groove Width**: 0.2 cm
- **Groove Depth**: 25% of knob diameter
- **Groove Height**: 70% of knob thickness

## Construction Process

### **Step 1: Basic Structure**
1. Create main handle with proper dimensions
2. Create fixed jaw (left side)
3. Create movable jaw (right side)
4. **Create connection bridge** ⭐ **NEW**
5. Union all main parts to create connected structure

### **Step 2: Jaw Openings** ⭐ **IMPROVED**
1. Create **larger** fixed jaw opening for better visibility
2. Create **larger** movable jaw opening for better visibility
3. Apply boolean difference operations

### **Step 3: Adjustment Mechanism**
1. Add threaded adjustment rod
2. Add adjustment knob
3. Create knurling pattern on knob

### **Step 4: Handle Grip**
1. Add 6 ergonomic grip grooves
2. Vary groove depths for better grip
3. Ensure proper spacing

### **Step 5: Surface Finish**
1. Apply fillets to all edges
2. Apply chamfers for professional finish
3. Validate final shape

## Visual Improvements

### **Proportions**
- More realistic size ratios
- Better balance between handle and head
- Proper jaw opening sizes

### **Details**
- Knurling pattern on adjustment knob
- Ergonomic handle grip
- Professional surface finish

### **Functionality**
- **Proper jaw openings for gripping** ⭐ **IMPROVED**
- Realistic adjustment mechanism
- Better visual representation of a real wrench

## Technical Notes

### **Boolean Operations**
- All operations use proper error checking
- Null shape validation at each step
- Graceful failure handling

### **Shape Validation**
- Final shape validation before creation
- Detailed topology analysis
- Face normal and index output for debugging

### **Performance**
- Optimized construction process
- Efficient boolean operations
- Proper memory management

## Recent Fixes ⭐ **NEW**

### **Problem 1: Disconnected Parts**
- **Issue**: Fixed jaw and movable jaw were not connected
- **Solution**: Added connection bridge between the two jaws
- **Result**: Single unified wrench structure

### **Problem 2: Invisible Jaw Openings**
- **Issue**: Jaw openings were too small to see clearly when zoomed in
- **Solution**: Significantly increased opening sizes
- **Result**: Much more visible and realistic jaw openings

### **Problem 3: Poor Structure**
- **Issue**: Parts appeared disconnected and unrealistic
- **Solution**: Improved connection structure and proportions
- **Result**: More realistic and professional appearance

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **V-shaped Jaw Openings**: More realistic gripping surfaces
2. **Thread Details**: Actual thread geometry on adjustment rod
3. **Material Properties**: Different materials for different parts
4. **Animation**: Adjustable jaw movement simulation
5. **Texture Mapping**: Surface textures for realistic appearance

### **Advanced Features**
