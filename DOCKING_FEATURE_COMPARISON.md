   - Active tab highlighting
   - Tab context menus

4. **Configuration System**
   - Feature flags per widget (Closable, Movable, etc.)
   - Global manager configuration flags
   - Customizable behavior

5. **Event System**
   - Widget lifecycle callbacks
   - Focus change notifications
   - Close event handling
   - Custom close handlers

6. **Visual Customization**

   - Opacity settings
   - Size constraints

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features

1. **Drag & Drop**
   - ✅ Basic tab dragging detection
   - ✅ Create floating window on drag
   - ✅ Overlay indicators (DockOverlay class exists)
   - ❌ Drop onto dock areas not fully working
   - ❌ Preview window during drag incomplete
   - ❌ Drop position calculation needs work

2. **Auto-Hide**
   - ✅ AutoHideContainer class implemented
   - ✅ Basic show/hide functionality
   - ✅ Animation framework
   - ❌ Integration with main UI incomplete
   - ❌ Side bar buttons not fully working

3. **Perspectives (Layouts)**
   - ✅ PerspectiveManager class implemented
   - ✅ XML serialization/deserialization
   - ✅ Named perspective support
   - ❌ Not fully integrated with UI
   - ❌ Some state not properly saved/restored

4. **Splitter Management**
   - ✅ Basic splitter functionality
   - ✅ Resize support
   - ❌ Equal split on insertion not working properly
   - ❌ Complex nested splitter layouts problematic

### ❌ Missing/Incomplete Features

1. **Advanced Drag & Drop**
   - Rubber band selection
   - Multi-tab dragging
   - Drag preview with live content
   - Smooth animation during dock
   - Edge detection for docking

2. **Advanced Tab Features**
   - Tab close buttons
   - Tab menu buttons
   - Elided text for long titles
   - Tab tooltips
   - Custom tab widgets

3. **Focus Management**
   - Focus highlighting
   - Focus history/restoration
   - Keyboard navigation between areas

4. **Advanced Auto-Hide**
   - Pin/unpin buttons fully working
   - Auto-hide timing configuration
   - Overlay widgets
   - Multiple auto-hide areas

5. **Serialization Edge Cases**
   - Floating window positions
   - Splitter sizes
   - Tab order preservation
   - Hidden widget states

6. **Platform Integration**
   - Native window decorations option
   - System theme integration
   - High DPI support
   - Multi-monitor awareness

## Key Implementation Differences

### Architecture
- **Qt-ADS**: Uses Qt's signal/slot system, QSplitter, native drag & drop
- **Our System**: Uses wxWidgets events, custom DockSplitter, manual drag handling

### Drag & Drop
- **Qt-ADS**: Leverages Qt's built-in drag & drop with QMimeData
- **Our System**: Manual mouse tracking and window creation

### Rendering
- **Qt-ADS**: Uses Qt's painting system with QPainter
- **Our System**: Uses wxDC for custom drawing

### State Management
- **Qt-ADS**: QSettings for persistence
- **Our System**: Custom XML serialization

## Current Limitations

1. **Drag & Drop**: The most significant limitation. While we detect drags and create floating windows, the actual docking (dropping back into the layout) is not fully functional.

2. **Auto-Hide**: The infrastructure exists but UI integration is incomplete. The pin button shows a message box instead of actually pinning.

3. **Complex Layouts**: Deeply nested splitter layouts can cause issues with parent-child relationships.

4. **Performance**: No lazy loading or virtualization for many tabs.

5. **Polish**: Missing many quality-of-life features like animations, smooth transitions, and visual feedback.

## Recommendations for Completion

1. **Priority 1: Fix Drag & Drop**
   - Implement proper drop detection in DockContainerWidget
   - Add preview overlay during drag
   - Handle drop animations
   - Fix coordinate transformation issues

2. **Priority 2: Complete Auto-Hide**
   - Wire up pin/unpin functionality
   - Add side bar buttons
   - Implement proper show/hide animations

3. **Priority 3: Polish Tab System**
   - Add close buttons to tabs
   - Implement tab menus
   - Add drag preview for tabs

4. **Priority 4: Improve Persistence**
   - Save all widget states
   - Preserve floating window positions
   - Handle splitter ratios correctly

## Conclusion

The docking system has a solid foundation with most core classes implemented. The architecture closely follows Qt-ADS patterns adapted for wxWidgets. However, several key features need completion, particularly drag & drop functionality, which is essential for a docking system. The current state is approximately 60-70% complete compared to Qt-ADS functionality.
