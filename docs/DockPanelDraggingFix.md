# Dock Panel Dragging Fix

## Problem
When dragging dock panels to the direction indicators (dock guides), the dock layout was not changing and panels were not being properly docked.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **ApplyLayoutToWidgets not applying panel positions**: The `ApplyLayoutToWidgets` method in `LayoutEngine.cpp` was only handling splitter nodes but not applying the calculated layout positions to panel nodes.

2. **FindTargetPanel always returning null**: The `FindTargetPanel` method in `DragDropController.cpp` had placeholder code that always returned `nullptr`, preventing proper target panel identification.

3. **GetDockPosition not checking dock guides**: The `GetDockPosition` method in `ModernDockManager.cpp` was only checking mouse position relative to panels, not checking if the mouse was over dock guides.

4. **No way to get target panel from dock guides**: When dragging over dock guides, there was no way to retrieve which panel the guides were associated with.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed ApplyLayoutToWidgets
Added code to apply layout to panel nodes:
```cpp
// If this is a panel node, apply its layout
if (node->GetType() == LayoutNodeType::Panel && node->GetPanel()) {
    wxRect rect = node->GetRect();
    node->GetPanel()->SetSize(rect);
    node->GetPanel()->Show();
}
```

### 2. Implemented FindTargetPanel
Replaced placeholder with proper implementation that:
- Checks if the hit-tested window is already a ModernDockPanel
- Searches through all panels to find which one contains the hit-tested window
- Walks up the parent hierarchy to find the containing panel

### 3. Updated GetDockPosition
Modified to check dock guides first:
```cpp
// First check if mouse is over a dock guide - this takes priority
if (m_dockGuides && m_dockGuides->IsVisible()) {
    DockPosition guidePosition = m_dockGuides->GetActivePosition();
    if (guidePosition != DockPosition::None) {
        return guidePosition;
    }
}
```

### 4. Added GetDockGuideTarget Support
- Added `GetCurrentTarget()` method to DockGuides class
- Added `GetDockGuideTarget()` to IDockManager interface
- Implemented in ModernDockManager to return the current target panel from dock guides
- Updated ValidateDrop to use the target panel from dock guides when dragging over them

### 5. Added GetAllPanels Method
- Added `GetAllPanels()` to IDockManager interface
- Implemented in ModernDockManager to return all panels
- Used in FindTargetPanel for searching through panels

## Result
With these fixes, dragging dock panels to the direction indicators now properly:
1. Detects when the mouse is over a dock guide
2. Identifies the correct target panel
3. Calculates the appropriate dock position
4. Updates the layout tree structure
5. Applies the new layout to reposition panels
6. Shows the changes visually

The dock panel system now correctly responds to dragging panels onto the directional guides, allowing users to dock panels to the left, right, top, bottom, or center (as tabs) of other panels.
