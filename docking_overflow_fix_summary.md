# Docking System Overflow Button Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Tab Overflow Button Positioning Fixed

#### In `DockAreaTabBar.cpp`:
- **Modified `updateTabRects()` method**: 
  - Now properly tracks the last visible tab's end position
  - Positions overflow button 4 pixels after the last visible tab
  - Uses same Y position and height as tabs for proper alignment
  - Changed from full height (y=0, height=GetClientSize().GetHeight()) to aligned with tabs

- **Modified `checkTabOverflow()` method**:
  - Removed duplicate code that was causing incorrect positioning
  - Improved calculation of visible tabs with adaptive widths
  - Added 4px minimum distance consideration in overflow calculation

#### In `DockAreaMergedTitleBar.cpp`:
- **Modified `updateTabRects()` method**:
  - Added tracking of last visible tab position
  - Positions overflow button 4px after last visible tab
  - Ensures minimum 4px distance from title bar buttons
  - Added maxOverflowX calculation to prevent overlap with title bar buttons

### 2. Title Bar Button Spacing Fixed

#### In `DockAreaMergedTitleBar.cpp`:
- **Modified constructor**:
  - Changed `m_buttonSpacing` from 2 to 0

- **Modified `onPaint()` method**:
  - Changed button positioning to have 0 margin from top, right, and bottom edges
  - Buttons now start from `buttonX = clientRect.GetWidth()` (right edge)
  - Button height set to `clientRect.GetHeight() - 1` (full height minus bottom border)
  - Button Y position set to 0 (top edge)

- **Modified `updateTabRects()` method**:
  - Updated button width calculation to remove spacing between buttons
  - Removed extra margin that was added to buttonsWidth

## Key Improvements

1. **Overflow button alignment**: Now properly aligned with tabs instead of overlapping with title bar
2. **Proper spacing**: Maintains 4px distance from last visible tab and title bar buttons
3. **Zero button margins**: Title bar buttons now have 0 spacing and touch the edges as requested
4. **Dynamic positioning**: Both overflow button and title bar buttons properly adjust when window is resized

## Testing

A test file `test_docking_overflow.cpp` was created to verify:
- Overflow button appears when tabs don't fit
- Overflow button maintains 4px spacing from last visible tab
- Overflow button maintains minimum 4px distance from title bar buttons
- Title bar buttons have 0 spacing and 0 margin from edges
- Dynamic positioning works correctly on window resize
